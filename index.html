            <h2> Who am I?</h2>
            <p> Hello! My name is <strong> Elaina Lyons </strong> and I am a first-year <em> computer science </em> student at Cal Poly.
            I love to be outside, whether that be running, mountain biking, paddle boarding, hiking, or skiing near my home in <em> Denver, Colorado.</em>
            Other hobbies of mine include playing the <strong> piano </strong> (which I've been doing for 13 years), <strong>reading</strong> 
            (currently the Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson) and hanging out with <strong> friends!</strong></p>
            <p> I love to <em> code </em>and would love to work with <em> Hack4Impact </em>on their exciting projects!</p>
