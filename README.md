# Elaina's Personal Website
This is a personal website built using the Hack4Impact Starter Pack!
My name is Elaina Lyons and I am a first year CS student at Cal Poly from Denver, Colorado! I love to be outside (bike, run, hike, ski, backpack), read (fantasy/fiction), play piano (really anything), and hang out with my friends!
